                    <p>Stem cell therapy involves the extraction, processing, and reinfusion of your own stem cells or donor stem cells into the affected areas of your body. This minimally invasive procedure is performed by experienced medical professionals, ensuring safety and efficacy. The stem cells then work to repair and regenerate damaged tissues, providing long-lasting relief and improvement.</p>
